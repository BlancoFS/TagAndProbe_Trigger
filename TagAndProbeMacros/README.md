### The recipe described here produces the trigger efficiency of electron triggers using Tag and Probe method.
#### The steps are described below.
##### The input to this code is a flat root tree containing the branches needed for calculation.
##### The tree is produced using the following code : https://github.com/arunhep/TagAndProbe_Trigger/blob/LPC_HATs2021/NtupleProducer

### Description of Files
   * *test.txt* : it contains the path of input root file
   * *TagAndProbe_Ele.C* : main macro to apply tag and probe procedure and producing the histograms of passing and failing probes
